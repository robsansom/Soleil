        q: 'How does Soleil work out my burn window?',
        a: 'Soleil combines the live UV index where you are (from Apple WeatherKit) with your Fitzpatrick skin type, your SPF and what you\u2019re wearing. That produces a personal estimate of how long your skin has before burn risk builds. It\u2019s guidance, not a guarantee - shade, water, altitude and reflection all matter too.'
      },
      {
        q: 'How do I set my skin type?',
        a: 'During onboarding you can answer a few questions, use the camera scan, or pick your Fitzpatrick type directly. The optional AI-assisted scan sends one photo through a secure proxy purely to estimate skin tone - or you can keep everything on-device. You can change your skin type any time in the You tab.'
      },
      {
        q: 'How do family profiles and check-ins work?',
        a: 'Add the people you look after in the You tab. A family check-in asks who\u2019s protected right now, and Soleil schedules reapply reminders for each person based on their SPF. Family features are free and stay on your device - nothing is shared or uploaded.'
      },
      {
        q: 'What do I need for the Apple Watch features?',
        a: 'The free Watch app works on watchOS with a paired iPhone, showing UV, sunscreen state and daylight, with haptic reapply nudges and complications. The Real Sun daylight story uses Apple\u2019s Time in Daylight, which needs an Apple Watch SE (2nd gen), Series 6 or later, or any Ultra.'
      },
      {
        q: 'Does reapplying sunscreen reset my sun exposure?',
        a: 'No - and that\u2019s deliberate. Reapplying renews your protection going forward, but the UV your skin has already received today stays counted. Soleil tracks both separately, so your daily total is always honest.'
      },
      {
        q: 'What\u2019s in Soleil Pro, and what does it cost?',

It\u2019s $3.99/month, $19.99/year (with a 3-day free trial), or $69.99 once for lifetime. The Watch app, family protection, widgets, alerts and weekly history all stay free.'
